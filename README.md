# ⚡ React with Vite: My Learning Journey

Welcome to my **React with Vite** learning journey! This repository will serve as a guide and record of my experience building React applications with the Vite bundler. 🎯

## 🚀 Why Vite?

- **Fast Development**: Vite provides lightning-fast development with Hot Module Replacement (HMR) for an amazing developer experience.

- **Optimized Build**: Vite uses Rollup under the hood to provide highly optimized production builds.

- **Easy Setup**: Minimal configuration and great integration with modern front-end tools.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- ⚛️ **React.js**

- ⚡ **Vite**

- 💻 **JavaScript (ES6+)**

- 🎨 **CSS & Sass**

- 🧪 **Testing with Jest & React Testing Library**

- 📦 **Node.js & npm**

## 🎯 Learning Plan

I will be working through the following key areas as I dive into React with Vite:

1. **Project Setup**: Setting up a React app using Vite.

2. **Component Structure**: Learning how to build reusable components.

3. **State Management**: Using React Hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, etc.).

4. **Routing**: Setting up client-side routing with React Router.

5. **Styling**: Applying CSS, Sass, and TailwindCSS.

6. **Build & Deployment**: Building and deploying the application.
